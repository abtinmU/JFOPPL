# JFOPPL
A simple first-order probabilistic programming language in Julia. This PPL supports the following inference algorithms:
- Importance Sampling
- Metropolis Hastings
- Gibbs Sampling
- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- Varitational Inference

The implementations were done mainly following [Frank Wood's Graduate Course on Probabilistic Programming](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS532W-539W/syllabus/) and the texts on design and implementation of probabilistic programming languages: [Intro to Prob Prog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756) and [DIPPL](https://dippl.org/).
